# Focus schools

You’ll either Run Madurai or Zenurik based on what you have. The following will help you decide which focus school to run.

## Madurai
Best tree to run if you have primed sure footed and aren’t worried about getting staggered	 maxing out the “Sling Strength” node will give you 40% power strength for 20 seconds when you dash twice in operator mode which is great if you’re doing super long runs or if your power strength mods aren’t maxed out yet.
(Mandatory for [Wisp])

## Zenurik 
If you’ve already invested into Zenurik for general gameplay and have Primed sure footed then “Wellspring” node will give your team energy regen which can be nice and “Hardened wellspring” node will give your entire team 20% power strength, very nice if you haven’t invested into madurai and have PSF already (One player should run this. It should be either [Saryn] or [Mirage])
