## Wisp
*Support Frame, buffs team*

### Strategy
Mote setup:
DD with operator for Madurai Sling strength
Place your [Nidus Specter][Specters] and wait for it to tether you 
Stack up [Arcane Power Ramp] by using 2 and 3
Use an operator ability to trigger [Molt Vigor]
Get energy orb
Put down a health mote
Get energy orb
Place another [Nidus Specter][Specters] and wait for it to tether you so you get the [Archon Intensify] bonus strength
DD with operator for Madurai Sling strength
Use an operator ability to trigger [Molt Vigor]
Put down a haste mote

After Mote Setup repeat this:
DD with operator for Madurai Sling strength
Use an operator ability to trigger [Molt Vigor]
Get energy orb
Cast [Roar]
Throw down [Afentis], then run to enemy spawns and clear them out on smaller maps with sporelancer
When you reach max stacks on molt augmented, make sure to reset your motes so they benefit off the additional 60% power strength

[Nidus Specter][Specters] is key to increasing your Ability Strength to the high levels desired for Arbitrations

You can also go for a Tri-Umbra build on Wisp replacing Augur Secrets, Archon Intensify and Amar's hatred with the 3 Umbral mods.
The Tri-Umbra  build has a higher cost due to the availability of Umbra Forma, but you can also just slot Rank 0 Umbral Fiber and Umbral Vitality which are purchasable from Cephalon Simaris.
You will have slightly worse motes with this build but it's way easier to use.

### Advanced Information
[Power Donation] and [Enemy Radar] are interchangeable, coordinate with your team as one person running [Enemy Radar] can really help with shooting at spawns but make sure at least 3 people are running [Power Donation]
