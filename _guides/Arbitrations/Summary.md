# Summary
## Basic Strategy

The goal of [Arbitrations] is to kill enemies as quickly as you can after they spawn, as more kills per minute will equal more [Vitus Essence]. [Arbitration Drones][Arbitration Shield Drone] (which drop vitus essence) will spawn up to a maximum of 5 alive on the map at once, so **fast kills = more loot** and that's the gist of it. You'll be running a lot of Power strength + Ability duration and applying a lot of buffs to yourself and your team so even in very long runs you'll still be killing every enemy with one shot. Your team will set up on one point of the map from where you can see all spawns and you'll shoot at enemy spawn points from that point of the map, everyone will stay at this point of the map and only leave to go pick up loot between rounds after which you will come back to this point of the map to refresh all your buffs. 

This guide contains some minimum requirement builds and min-maxed builds for the meta warframes.

The 4 main meta frames for Arbitrations are: 
 - [Saryn] (The main damage dealer) Advanced
 - [Mirage] (Buffer + secondary damage dealer) Advanced
 - [Chroma] (Another buffer + secondary damage dealer) Beginner friendly
 - [Wisp] (A support buffer frame who will also run a support weapon that buffs your team) Beginner friendly
 
To get more out of your Arbi's you should run with a resource booster and have a companion with [Resourceful Retriever], get a dropchance blessing before the run and have atleast 1 player with a dropchance booster in your squad.
