## Afentis
Wisp will be running [Afentis](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Afentis) to boost her team. Drop Afentis where your team camps and refresh the buff when it’s about to run out, you get Afentis from rank 5 Kahl garrison so if you don’t have that, just use the [Kuva Ogris] and DPS with your team

Chroma sometimes takes an additional [Afentis](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Afentis) since he won't really be able to kill much in good squads with the Ogris anyways.
