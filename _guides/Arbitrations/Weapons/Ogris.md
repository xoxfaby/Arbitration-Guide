## Kuva Ogris
For Arbitrations we currently use a Toxin Progenitor to create corrosive damage on Mirage with a single purple shard.
Saryn can use a Cold Progenitor to get viral with the modded toxin but that is not needed at all, since Saryn has more than enought damage already.
A Riven is not required at all and if you have a Riven replace Vigilante Armaments. 
Make sure to equip the bane mod since it’s a must have. Non-primed bane is fine too. 
[Nightwatch Napalm] leaves lingering AOE damage zones, these will kill enemies on spawn as long as you’re firing at the spawn points which makes this the best weapon for Arbitrations.
MAKE SURE YOUR OGRIS ENERGY COLOR IS PURE BLACK, or you’ll blind all your teammates with the visual effect

### Basic Build for Saryn

The diffrence between the Ogris builds is that Saryn wants to mod for more toxin damage with [Infected Clip] while Mirage uses the slot to get a better magazine size.
