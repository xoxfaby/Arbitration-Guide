## Kuva Ogris
For Arbitrations we currently use a Toxin Progenitor to create corrosive damage on Mirage with a single purple shard and buff the damage for toxic lash napalm for Saryn. Riven is not required at all. Make sure to equip the bane mod since it’s a must have. Non-primed bane is fine too. [Nightwatch Napalm] leaves lingering AOE damage zones, these will kill enemies on spawn as long as you’re firing at the spawn points which makes this the best weapon for Arbitrations.
MAKE SURE YOUR OGRIS ENERGY COLOR IS PURE BLACK, or you’ll blind all your teammates with the visual effect


### Build for Mirage and Chroma

The diffrence between the Ogris builds is that Saryn wants to mod for more toxin damage with [Pathogen Rounds] while Mirage uses the slot to get a better magazine size.
